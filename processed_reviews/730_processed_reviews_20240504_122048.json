The wall-clipper, literally i just want to smash my metal water bottle directly onto their throat so they wont ruin my day again.\n\nPlease, i know you guys working hard and putting so many efforts on this game, i appreciate your great work. But please at least put a exploit tracker like other games.\n\nThe graphics are incredible, unlike Warzone. It runs smoothly on my laptop, but somehow quick freezing appears randomly and it slightly lowering my gaming experience. My laptop has 16GB of RAM and GTX 2050. At first i thought it was because my device is kinda weak, now im not asking for other updates to fix this one, but i need some advice or solution and way to fix this problem.",

        "review": "Counter-Strike 2 - A Pale Imitation:\r\nIn stark contrast to the brilliance of CS:GO, Counter-Strike 2 pales in comparison, failing to capture the essence of its predecessor or offer anything new or innovative to the franchise. From its lackluster gameplay to its uninspired design, Counter-Strike 2 feels like a half-hearted attempt to cash in on the success of its predecessor rather than a genuine effort to push the series forward.\r\n\r\nOne of the most glaring flaws of Counter-Strike 2 is its lack of depth and complexity. Compared to the finely tuned mechanics of CS:GO, Counter-Strike 2 feels simplistic and shallow, with gameplay that fails to engage or excite players. The gunplay lacks the precision and satisfaction of its predecessor, with weapons feeling unbalanced and uninspired. Additionally, the game's map design is lackluster and uninspired, offering little in the way of strategic depth or tactical nuance.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Counter-Strike 2 suffers from a lack of innovation and creativity. Rather than building upon the foundation laid by CS:GO, the game feels like a rehash of tired ideas and stale concepts. There is a distinct lack of innovation in both gameplay mechanics and content, leaving players feeling underwhelmed and disappointed.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nIn conclusion, the disparity between Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Counter-Strike 2 is glaring and undeniable. While CS:GO stands as a shining example of excellence in the world of tactical shooters, Counter-Strike 2 languishes in the shadows, unable to capture the magic of its predecessor or offer anything new or innovative to the franchise. CS:GO's strategic depth, balanced gameplay, and thriving esports scene set it apart as a true masterpiece of the genre, while Counter-Strike 2 fades into obscurity as a forgettable footnote in the franchise's history.",

It feels like rock,paper,scissiors where you have to live with the consequences for the rest of the match because there absolutely have been times where I've been like \"Damn I could use a negev for holding down this choke during save, but I got it out of the wheel because I use it so rarely.\" It also essentially removes some of the less popular weapons from the game because when in the world are you gonna be rocking the M249 in your loadout?\n\nAlso the lack of maps; I'm sorry but CSGO had been slowly hiding away tons of maps and CS2 continues that trend. Where's Lake, Safehouse, Monastery, Agency, Bank, Train, Cache, Canals, Cobble, Sugarcane, Militia etc? I get that a ton of these weren't \"competitive\" but removing them? Nah. The game feels stale despite the gameplay changes. Maps where the main thing that offered difference in your gameplay experience and the smaller map-pool can be really felt when I look at the matchmaking and feel; \"I am not feeling any of these rn\"\n\nIt's just such a shame that for what otherwise was such a nice update we've lost SO much. Workshop is thankfully slowly filling up with map ports but idk, as much as I adore Counter Strike it just feels... lesser now. While I know some of the maps will of course make it back I doubt the full roster will ever return. \n\nI still \"recommend it\" as it is the best of its kind imo, but just know that tons of stuff is missing and as someone who's been playing the game on and off for 10 years now it just stings.",

Its allure is magnetic, drawing in players from all corners of the globe with promises of adrenaline-fueled chaos and unfathomable challenges.\n\nAt first glance, it seems like any other online shooter \u2013 guns, bombs, knives, and skins \u2013 all the ingredients for a virtual warzone. But beneath the surface lies a world teeming with its own unique ecosystem of players and perils.\n\nMeet Alex, an unsuspecting gamer lured into the fray by the siren song of Fragged Realities. With each match, he plunges deeper into the rabbit hole, encountering a menagerie of adversaries and allies. Among them are the enigmatic Russians, with their terse commands and lightning reflexes, the elusive hackers who bend the rules of the game to their will, and the smurfs, masters of disguise who lurk in the shadows, ready to strike.\n\nBut the true heart of Fragged Realities lies not in its mechanics, but in its community \u2013 a motley crew of players bound together by their shared love-hate relationship with the game. From the camaraderie of battle-scarred veterans to the venomous barbs of toxic teammates, every interaction shapes Alex's journey through the digital battlefield.\n\nAs he navigates the tumultuous waters of Fragged Realities, Alex finds himself on a quest not just for victory, but for understanding. Through the crucible of conflict, he learns new languages \u2013 Russian, Turkish, Portuguese, Arabic \u2013 and discovers a lexicon of profanity and slang unique to the game. Cyka, blyat, noob, kurwa \u2013 each word a badge of honor, a testament to his perseverance in the face of adversity.\n\nBut for every triumph, there is a setback. For every moment of glory, a crushing defeat. Alex rages, he cries, he uninstalls, he reinstalls, trapped in an endless cycle of addiction and frustration. And yet, through it all, he cannot deny the allure of Fragged Realities \u2013 a game that consumes him, heart and soul.\n\nIn the end, perhaps that is the truest testament to its greatness. For despite its flaws, despite its challenges, Fragged Realities endures, a beacon of chaos in an ever-changing digital landscape. Love it or hate it, play it or leave it \u2013 the choice is yours. But one thing is certain: once you enter the world of Fragged Realities, you can never truly escape.",

        "review": "Counter-Strike 2 (CS2) is a highly acclaimed first-person shooter that continues to captivate players with its intense gameplay and strategic depth. Developed by Valve Corporation, this sequel to the iconic Counter-Strike franchise delivers a compelling experience for both new players and seasoned veterans.\r\n\r\nGameplay:\r\nCS2 maintains the core gameplay mechanics that made its predecessors so popular. Players choose between terrorists and counter-terrorists, each with distinct objectives. Whether it's defusing bombs, rescuing hostages, or eliminating the opposing team, every round requires precision, teamwork, and quick reflexes. The tactical depth of CS2 is unmatched, offering a variety of weapons, equipment, and strategies to employ.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Sound:\r\nVisually, CS2 impresses with detailed environments, realistic weapon models, and smooth animations. The sound design adds to the immersion, with authentic weapon sounds, footsteps, and ambient effects that enhance the atmosphere of intense firefights.\r\n\r\nMaps and Modes:\r\nCS2 features a diverse selection of maps set in various locations around the world. Each map presents unique challenges and strategic opportunities, keeping gameplay fresh and engaging. The game offers a range of modes, including classic bomb defusal, hostage rescue, and team deathmatch, catering to different playstyles and preferences.\r\n\r\nCommunity and Competitiveness:\r\nOne of CS2's strengths is its vibrant community and competitive scene. Players can participate in ranked matchmaking, tournaments, and community events, showcasing their skills and competing for recognition on leaderboards. The active community also ensures a steady stream of updates, patches, and new content, keeping the game dynamic and evolving.\r\n\r\nPotential Drawbacks:\r\nWhile CS2 excels in many areas, it's not without its flaws. Newcomers may find the learning curve steep, especially when facing experienced players. Toxicity within the community, including cheating and negative behavior, can also detract from the overall experience for some players.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nCounter-Strike 2 remains a cornerstone of the FPS genre, offering fast-paced action, strategic depth, and a thriving competitive community. Its combination of tactical gameplay, diverse maps, and competitive modes ensures lasting appeal for fans of shooters. While challenges exist, the overall experience of CS2 is undeniably exhilarating, making it a must-play for anyone seeking intense multiplayer action.",

I was hoping that with the release of CS2 they would make a good anti-cheat like for Faceit or Valorant, but the developers did nothing. Everything became even worse than it was in csgo.\nIn 9 out of 10 games you will have legit or rage cheaters, it doesn\u2019t matter, but they will happen. This is an ideal trust factor, I can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s going on with those who just downloaded the game.\nThe game is simply unplayable. In Premier there are only RAGE cheaters which kill your entire team through 10 walls to the head in a second. In MM mode, at 5 silver there are also rage cheaters. The developers don't care. GAME DEAD. Honest players have nothing to do here. Standing AFK at spawn is all that can be done here, it\u2019s not possible to play normally here.",

        "review": "I love counter strike, however the linux build is currently unplayable... I can't get over 30fps on CS2 even with high end hardware and optimal drivers, but I can run cyberpunk just fine with raytracing. The hitreg is really hit or miss depending on what server I'm connected to, sometimes I can hit shots just like I did in CS:GO and sometimes I need to aim a foot to the left of people to hit them? I had to resort to playing on a virtual machine with gpu passthrough which gets 3x the fps of the native build for linux but still has the same hitreg issues. Also the linux build has an issue where you can see people firing guns through walls which last I checked was still unpatched, Not like the info will make much difference at 30fps.\n\nI do have faith that in future updates linux compatibility will get better considering I got far better fps on linux with CS:GO than I did with windows prior to CS2.\n\nFor anyone playing on linux I'd recommend setting up hardware passthrough and continuing to play in a kvm virtual machine (If you only use linux), if not then I guess just use windows.\n\nHopefully Valve can fix some of these issues once the cheater problem is solved :)\n\n*Will update review once linux compatability is restored*",

This game is very addictive, game wise and also when buying cases with low chances and cool skins that can seem cool and become expensive over time. However, the negative about this game is that there is no anti-cheat, at least at this time which makes the game unplayable because any game that is play there is a guaranteed cheater that will beat you easily, they don't get banned from the game and there is nothing anyone can do about it. The cases in this game are quite cheap but very addictive which is basically gambling but paying more for the key than the case is outrageous. Overall, the game is really fun and could be a good beginner game but can be hard at first because everyone is competitive which will be difficult to play and learn all the skills but overtime the skills will show.",

People don't even try to play, they're more focused on cursing at eachother while being equally garbage at the game, they grief like no tomorrow and yell like crazy 10-year-olds over the mic. If it's not a horrible team, you get cheaters on the other end, too salty to accept the fact they came up against someone better than them. There's no way to get an appropriate rank as you can't even play 10 games properly(I alt+f4 my last 2 games because 20yo+ people act like spoiled brats. Back in GO people would at least give the match a shot. Now it's a pissing contest as soon one round is lost...",

From the moment I fired up the game, I was hit with a wave of nostalgia... and embarrassment.\n\nLet's talk graphics. It's like someone took a time machine back to the 90s and decided, \"Hey, let's make everything look like it's made of pixels!\" But you know what? It weirdly works. It's like staring into the abyss of outdated graphics and finding a strange kind of beauty in it.\n\nAnd the sound effects? Oh boy. It's like a symphony of cringe-inducing noises that make you question your life choices. From the overly dramatic explosions to the cheesy voice acting, every sound in CS2 is a masterpiece of awkwardness.\n\nBut wait, there's more! Let's talk about the storyline. It's like the writers took every clich\u00e9 from every B-list action movie ever made and mashed them together into one glorious mess. You've got your generic hero, your evil villain with a questionable accent, and of course, the damsel in distress who can't seem to do anything without the hero's help.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the gameplay. It's like trying to navigate through a maze blindfolded while juggling flaming swords. It's frustrating, it's confusing, but somehow... it's addicting.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for a game that will make you cringe so hard you'll feel it in your soul, then CS2 is the game for you. Just make sure to have a bottle of eye bleach and a therapist on standby. You're gonna need it.",

        "review": "is good Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) has solidified its place as one of the most iconic and enduring multiplayer first-person shooters of all time. Developed by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment, this iteration of the legendary Counter-Strike series brings together refined gameplay mechanics, intense tactical engagements, and a thriving competitive scene that continues to captivate players worldwide.\r\n\r\nGameplay (9/10):\r\nCS:GO's gameplay is a masterclass in the FPS genre. The core mechanics are simple yet deep, emphasizing teamwork, strategy, and skill. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer, the game offers something for everyone, thanks to its accessible yet challenging gameplay. Matches are fast-paced and adrenaline-fueled, demanding quick reflexes, precise aim, and clever tactics to outsmart opponents. The variety of weapons, maps, and game modes ensures that no two matches feel the same, keeping the experience fresh and engaging.\r\n\r\nGraphics and Sound (8/10):\r\nWhile CS:GO's graphics may not push the boundaries of realism, they remain functional and polished, with clean visuals that prioritize performance over flashy effects. The character models and weapon designs are well-crafted, allowing for easy identification of friend and foe amidst the chaos of battle.

        "review": "\r\nWhile \"Counter-Strike 2\" isn't a real game as of my last update, it's possible to explore hypothetical reasons why a sequel to Counter-Strike, a highly popular and influential first-person shooter, might be considered the \"best game ever\" by some:\r\n\r\nRefinement of Gameplay: Counter-Strike has a simple yet highly strategic gameplay loop that involves teamwork, tactics, and skill. A sequel could refine these mechanics, offering even tighter controls, more balanced gameplay, and enhanced graphics.\r\nExpanded Content: A sequel could introduce new maps, weapons, game modes, and customization options, providing players with fresh experiences while still maintaining the core elements that made the original so beloved.\r\nCommunity Engagement: Counter-Strike has a passionate and dedicated community that creates custom maps, mods, and other content. A sequel could foster even greater community involvement, potentially integrating user-generated content more seamlessly into the game.\r\nCompetitive Scene: Counter-Strike has a thriving esports scene, with tournaments attracting millions of viewers and offering substantial prize pools. A sequel could further support the competitive aspect of the game, introducing features designed specifically for esports and competitive play.\r\nTechnical Advancements: With advances in technology, a sequel could leverage new hardware capabilities to deliver more immersive visuals, smoother gameplay, and innovative features that were not possible in the original game.\r\nNostalgia and Legacy: For fans of the original Counter-Strike, a sequel could evoke feelings of nostalgia while also introducing the franchise to a new generation of players, building upon the legacy of one of the most iconic shooters in gaming history.\r\nThese are just a few potential reasons why a hypothetical \"Counter-Strike 2\" could be considered the \"best game ever\" by some players. Ultimately, what makes a game the \"best\" is highly subjective and varies from person to person based on their preferences and experiences.",

Some cheat more subtle others do not hide it at all. It is frustrating and I cannot understand why it is not Valve's number 1 priority to fix this problem. After four games (3 against cheaters and one with a cheater in our game) today my mates already said that they will not play any more.",

I think some of the things they have done with CS2 vs csgo are incredible, such as the smokes, the graphics, etc. However, there are a few glaring issues:\n\n1) The cheaters. Even having prime with never cheating, and even though this account only has around 400 hrs and the trust factor may not be incredible, it shouldn't be this bad. Nearly every game is just hvh. And since its me and my non cheating friends vs hackers, its just a lose simulator. Compounding this is that you can't surrender without a teammate abandoning, which will automatically lose them a ton of elo (more that if we were to just lose) and so you have to sit through the whole game while they b hop to your spawn and kill you while shooting faster than should be possible. And as for getting the hackers banned? Yeah, good one. Accounts that were blatant (bhops, walls, aim, etc) that I faced months ago are still going strong. Reporting does nothing. Vac live is a joke. \n\n2) Lack of content compared to CSGO. CS2 hasn't had an operation, it lacks a ton of maps and gamemodes, the community server browser is ass, and on top of that you can't even host a custom map/server with friends to play that lost content without going through a bunch of port forwarding, which wasn't necessary in csgo. \n\nThere are other complaints I could go into, such as subtick vs 128 tick, valve's greed with skins, replacing csgo vs just creating a new store page for cs2, or a whole host of issues, but I think that the two I went into more detail on are the main problems that prevent me from recommending the game. Its a shame because I still have fond memories of the game and I want really really bad for it to be good.\n\nValve please fix\n\nedit: formatting",

I can say that I'm sad to see how cheaters completley ruined the game although it had the potential to be such a huge change from CSGO.\n(But i still owe this game for helping me develop my aim to levels i never thought i'll reach).",

The fact skins, guns, etc. can be traded and collected is also a neat aspect to the game!",

Game itself can be really fun but hardest part is being able to actually play a worthwhile match. Game might be nice in another 1-2 years but for now it sucks. Valve needs to go back into their \"development\" phase as opposed to the \"marketplace\"/do nothing and profit mindset they've been in for a long time now. Of course I might just be bitter that my account got hijacked and I lost all my skins to a level 0 account that still is not banned yet I was notified that Steam/valve won't return the items. That was kind of my breaking point lol",

Mild inconvenience, much needed issue, happy for that change. Now game says I need to play 1 match to get my rating back (had around 150 wins in competitive when it was still CS:GO). Cool I guess let's win a quick one and then we can play together next.\n\nAfter 1 win, game decides that in reality I need 9 more wins, because who cares about previous merits. F*ck it, let's get that rank. Now according to the community I got lucky that I only had 1 cheater every other game. Played 6 matches, 3 of them lost, because of someone just 1 tap HS-ing you through a wall and smoke.\n\nPublic servers are full of bots farming cases.\n\nThe game experience is a downhill since they decided to make it F2P, on EU servers you get matched with Russian, only speaking, guess what, Russian.\n\nIt was nice getting back to CS. In 2 more years it might be playable. Currently I can only recommend to stay away.\n\nIn case a Valve employee reads this: I know you can do better. Please do.",

Implement a real anti-cheat system, or change how competitive works without putting people through CBT first.

Counter Strike is and will forever be the most perfect FPS skill based video game ever created. Once you are hooked there is no going back. I have been playing CS for a while and there is no other game that can compare with its style of gun play and competitive nature.  A skill based game at its finest. Games have tried (like dog sh** valorant ) but at the end of the day nothing beats the simplicity of COUNTER STRIKE! ___ LONG LIVE CS",

        "review": "Despite what you may hear about this game from spazzers and youtubers, the Valve dev team has done something truly innovative with this game.  No amount of flashy gimmicks can make up for lack of depth in Counter-strike's competition. \r\nWith the addition of volumetric smoke grenades, the game has become even more nuanced.  The game is 20 years old and Valve hasn't stopped.  Valve continues to innovate, while their \"competition\" continues to mindlessly spit out cookie cutter slop.  You can't blame those guys, they are a product of their work culture.  GabeN continues to innovate, while everyone else duct tapes RGB lights onto their gold spray painted shopping carts.  \r\nIf you want a deep game without the gimmicks, and real substance, this is the game.  Great for all players.\r\nThe best FPS by a long shot.",

        "review": "Counter Strike 2, ah, where do I even begin? It's like diving into a kaleidoscope of digital euphoria, a symphony of pixels dancing in the ether of cyberspace. From the moment you click that icon and plunge into its enigmatic world, you're whisked away on a journey of... well, let's call it cosmic ambiguity.\r\n\r\nFirstly, let's talk about the graphics. Oh, the graphics! They're like a technicolor dreamcoat woven by the digital deities themselves. Each pixel, meticulously placed, seems to whisper secrets of a universe beyond comprehension. It's as if the game world exists in a state of perpetual flux, a perpetual dance of light and shadow that defies explanation.\r\n\r\nAnd the sound design! Ah, the sound design! It's like being serenaded by a chorus of celestial beings, their voices echoing through the vast expanse of the digital cosmos. Every gunshot, every footstep, every whispered utterance is a symphony unto itself, a cacophony of auditory ecstasy that transcends mortal understanding.\r\n\r\nBut let's not forget about the gameplay! Oh, the gameplay! It's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while riding a unicycle on a tightrope suspended over a pit of lava. Every movement, every decision, every fleeting thought is fraught with peril and possibility. It's a delicate balance of skill and strategy, a delicate dance of death that leaves you breathless and exhilarated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Counter Strike 2 is a masterpiece of digital artistry, a masterpiece of existential ambiguity that defies explanation. It's a journey into the unknown, a journey into the depths of the human soul that leaves you questioning everything you thought you knew. So, grab your mouse and keyboard, and prepare to embark on a journey unlike any other.",

        "review": "The use of cheats in CS 2 is a significant issue that makes the game unpleasant and creates an unfair competitive environment. Existing anti-cheat systems are not always 100% effective. This proposal introduces a new anti-cheat system that could significantly reduce cheating.\n\nThe proposed system is inspired by the Inspector System in CS:GO. Inspectors will be able to watch matches live, preventing information leaks by monitoring the game 2-3 rounds behind. There will be 10 inspectors per match, and if at least 8 inspectors vote that cheating is occurring, the match will be canceled, and the cheater will be penalized. This system has several advantages: faster and more accurate cheat detection, fewer false alarms, and community involvement. However, the disadvantages include difficulty in finding inspectors, inspector training, and inspector abuse.\n\nThe Live Inspector System has the potential to significantly reduce cheating. Despite its drawbacks, its advantages outweigh them. It is recommended that Valve consider integrating the system. Additionally, efforts should be made to establish criteria for becoming an inspector and to develop tools for monitoring inspector performance and detecting cheats.\n\nThe integration of this system into CS:GO 2 will substantially reduce cheating and make the game fairer and more enjoyable.\n\n(I recommend the game so that my recommendation goes to the top)\n\nThanks, best regards.",

        "review": "An enjoyable game with a simple concept that's difficult to master. Has a community that wants to continually improve the experience (workshop maps, weapons, stickers, etc.). The competitive aspect and professional scene provide a lot of entertainment and interaction with people around the world.\n\nDespite replacing CSGO, I understand that CS2 isn't supposed to be a one-to-one. It means that some core gameplay differs, but at times it can be difficult to determine if certain changes are intentional. Updates have seemed to bring gradual improvements, so this game has the opportunity to surpass CSGO; nailing the gameplay should be one of the main priorities.\n\nHowever, the game would greatly benefit from a basic anticheat that detects spinbotting, wallhacking, aimlocking, and XP boosting lobbies. This is the most glaring negative since it occurs in every game mode and shouldn't be tolerated. Reporting players in-game and via the player's Steam profile doesn't seem to do much as no confirmation is received as to whether appropriate action has taken place. Hoping that one day I'll be able to return to this review to say its frequency has dramatically reduced.",

But for real - winning is a gamble, not skill.\nNo anti-cheat detection. Reported players just continue hacking, even high rank ESEA matches. Nothing from VALVE about a new idea of new anti-cheat tools aka \"we like to sell our new weapon skins and easy life\"\nAlmost every game you have 1-2 hackers,  toggling with aimbot and/or wallhacks.\nafter the launch they dont get it work, to easy watch your highlights in replays \neven to just quicklook players if they are legit.\n- i mean how difficult must it be to fix it? Is it a money thing? do you need some?\nValve's update sends us back to primary school. Well done ladies & Gentlemen! \nRIP / Uninstall",

I'm not sure what it is about massive multiple player games on the internet that brings the absolute worst out of people, but whatever it is I hate it. The only conceivable way that a game like this can possibly be fun is if you are playing with friends. \r\nAlso fuck this game for taking so long to introduce new maps, outside of arguably one of the worst fps maps ever created - Vertigo. \r\nAbsolute dogshit video game, I'd recommend you go play quite literally anything else besides this game to respect yourself and your time.",

And they were blatantly hacking . How could you tell that someone just toggles the wallhack for a second , just to see where you are all positioned , and from there to make the right rotation . You'll just be like \" this guy has amazing gamesense \". If they are smart about it I don't think you could ever tell . \n\nNegative review because although I love this game , something has to be done about the cheating problem.",

I wanna play office, italy, and dust in premiere. limiting the competitive map pool is bad design imho\n\n3) why are loadouts even a thing? why can't the menu just have every available weapon on it? everyone is gonna have the good stuff equipped anyway. loadouts are also bad design imho\n\n4) why did this game get released in a worse state than csgo? what was the purpose of re-releasing the game? how is such a rich company incapable of making a good replacement for literally their most popular product aside from steam?",

Everyone that I know had a better experience jumping to that game (I can't because I've been addicted to Cheater-Strike since 2001 and I'm too old to get used to child like graphics and learning spells). Don't waste your time here.",

The first game of wingman I play in a very long time, I play against a guy who no-scope headshots me while b-hopping backwards with an ssg every single round, this leads to me losing the match and ranking down. I get mad, rq and don't play until a few days later. \r\n I come back to get my rank back up, same thing again happens again. This time I get to play 3 matches (2 wins and a tie) before I encounter another cheater. It's a guy who beams me with an mp9. first round it happens I just think he is skilled, but when he does the same thing, without even being visable on my screen, i get a bit more suspicius. So after a bunch of unfair gameplay, my teammate and I just kill ourselves (jump of the map on vertigo) the last 3 rounds until he wins. \r\n There you go, I didn't even think the cheater problem was real until this week, but apparently it is. gj valve in making the worst game ever.",

This can be a major problem, but if you keep getting better and start to win more and more and improve kd game after game, it starts being very rewarding to win. I feel this is why it's worth it to play the game and try to get better. I also seriously recommend, if you're playing with one other friend, to play wingman. Wingman is one of the most fun FPS modes I've played in a long time and it's really worth a try.",

        "review": "This game is great but there all multiple things keeping it from being amazing. I started playing a few months ago and I would say I am addicted to the game loop and satisfaction of clicking heads. It is also a lot of fun to play with friends, at least when were not bickering at each other or playing like crap. I also love the skins and how unique the trading system is, hopefully that doesn't get messed up by valve. However there is a massive problem in the game that is of course the cheaters. Out of every game I play among all the different platforms, this game is by far the worst game when it comes to cheating and its not even close. It genuinely blows my mind how many people cheat at this game, I would honestly say like maybe 30-35% of people are cheating and I feel like that's being generous. I could go on a tangent describing the types of games I've played and cheaters I've encountered, but I know this is getting long already so I'll just say that FaceIt's anti-cheat works so if you're fed up with cheaters in premier or competitive then head over there. I don't know what valve's solution to the cheaters should be given there's so many and in every rank and every mode and it feels like there's nothing you can do as a normal player to get them off the platform. At the end of the day valve will have to address this problem head on with a better VAC. But on a brighter note, I have met a bunch of cool people from playing this game and I do have fun playing it. For that I am recommending it. I also feel like more people playing the game will maybe thin out the cheaters. It's not a bad game, it just needs to be tended to and taken care of and in the right ways. I can't honestly say how much faith I have in valve but I do really hope for the best. This game has potential to last many more decades as long as they take care of it.",

Over the past few months, the community across various platforms\u2014including Reddit, Twitter, Twitch, and YouTube\u2014has voiced serious concerns regarding the prevalence of cheaters, particularly in Premier and Matchmaking modes.\r\n\r\nDespite the community's ongoing efforts to bring these issues to light, there seems to be a noticeable lack of effective countermeasures from Valve to address the situation. The absence of a robust anti-cheat system not only undermines the gameplay experience but also discourages fair play among the user base.\r\n\r\nIn light of these challenges, I urge the developers at Valve to prioritize the implementation of a more stringent anti-cheat system. Enhancing these measures would not only improve the competitive environment but also restore trust and satisfaction among your dedicated players. We appreciate the complexity of this issue, but a focused effort to combat cheating is essential for the longevity and success of CS2.",

Thanks to the new Source 2 engine, maps that players have known for more than 20 years are getting a makeover without changing one bit the range of possible tactics or the gameplay sensations. Basically, this update called Counter Strike 2 seems to be more about getting up to speed with the competition than attracting a new audience. What's the point of revolutionizing a team that's already winning?",

Free-to-play lobbies weren't so bad minus the occasional cheater or mismatched professional, so I thought I'd get Prime for the free cases and maybe become more interested in the game.\r\nYeah, no. First match I got kicked for no discernible reason, but before I was gone I took a look and saw everyone there was practically a player for an e-sports team. Decorated profiles, loads of expensive skins, and zero patience for mediocre players. Tried another match, similar results.\r\nIf I knew this was what Prime meant, I would've never bought it. I've been trying to get better bit by bit, but thanks to Prime my only opponents are Master Rank I's and higher while I'm hardly a Silver I. This is the most unfriendly and infuriating competitive scene I've witnessed in a while, and I wholeheartedly regret this.\r\n\r\nSo, as a message to anyone who may be wanting to get into this as a new player:\r\n\r\nDon't.",

THEY ARE NOT HONEST. THE HACKING PROBLEM CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE CONTROLLED.\n\nI have had 3 people in games the first 2 weeks i came back to playing who were blatantly hacking - spinbotting, whole 9 yards. At first my teammates didnt believe me until it they stopped trying to hide it and became blatant. Valve has still not banned these individuals and I have seen them each in at least 1 game after this.\n\nLike I said, I believe most of the player base here is hacking. Find another genre of game to play. This is a waste of time and filled with cheating sadistic narcissists with nothing else to do with their free time.",

        "review": "DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME UNLESS; you are a sadist or into BDSM! \n\nWhy you might ask?\nIn my last game we had a cheater on the other team, and people will ask how do we know that they are cheating. To This i ask, how good can you Bhop across the map and head shot everyone through walls in seconds while spinning at the same time?\n\nIf you do not know what i am talking about;\n\ni) Bunny hop (Bhop) [legit]/ AUTO/Assisted-Bhop [cheat] - a form of movement to increase ones speed by hitting jumps that will accelerate ones velocity in the game\n\nii) Aim bot - to use external applications that allow for the adjustment of ones aim to consistently hit the desired target with out fail. \n\niii) Anti AIM (AA) - to offset the visible character model from the hit-box model.\n\niv)Walls - to have the ability to see players through materiel that is not transparent.\n\nv) !!!! Spin bot !!!!- to combine all 4 into one category and spin.\n\nIn my last two game writing this review, both had Spin-Bots. This game is broken, and you will see a cheater in almost every game. \n\nFor those who do not believe that there are cheater everywhere and say that i'm not good or that they are just better i will bestow apon you information that will make you doubt every interaction until you properly review a game.\nVarious Cheats can allow for adjustments. what do i mean by this? Well, because of how advanced cheats have become cheaters/ hackers/ script kitty's can apply functions to there cheats. Intern creating subcategory of said cheats!\n\nSome Variation examples: 1)AIM Bots, 2) Walls 3) Other or tools\n1.1) Soft aim - to apply aim assistance once the cross air/ target reaches a set distance from the target (can apply a 360 degree)\n1.2) Low FOV aim assist - like soft aim but you need to have the target in sight\n1.3) Mag dependent Aim - Aim assist will not toggle \"ON\" unless a specific bullet(s) or amount are shot.\n1.4) Body Aim lock - you can adjust were your aim will lock and the intensity of said aim; Aim bot is not always set for the head and can be body parts like arms, legs, groin, chest etc.\n2.1) Radar - to show the location of all players (including the enemy) on ones mini map\n2.2) Distance specific walls - Walls but the player need to be in a specified distance\n2.3) Cross air lines - to show the line of ones gun allowing you to know if one is aiming or holding and area/angle\n2.4) utility walls - to only display ones weapon or device that is being held through walls\n2.5) Ping location walls - to ping the location of the enemy without line of sight.\n3.1) Toggle - to set a switch or key to turn ON or OFF the cheat; applys to everything aim, walls, etc\n3.2) open all chat - allows you to see all communication in chat box\n3.3) display teams purchases - lets you see what the enemy have bought \n3.4) graphical change - allows the for manipulation of texture for character model, sky, map, etc\n3.5) Third person perspective - (name says it all)\n3.6) List spectators - allows one to see who is viewing them; this is often used too let the cheater know when to toggle off so that they are not suspected of cheating\n3.7) Utill presets/ projections - allows / shows where to throw utill at the desired location\n\netc\n\nAs you can see cheaters are not stupid (alot of them are tho), and  they will try to hide the cheats. But just because you are bad at the game dose not mean you should cheat, just because everyone else is cheat dose not mean you should cheat. \n\nBecause of the huge influx of cheaters, i can not even play a game without a spin-bot'er or closet-cheater (someone who try's to hide there cheats) playing alongside or against me. It is frustrating because cheaters tip the scale of ranks. I have seen many players who are lacking in so much game knowledge and understanding in my ranks and above wondering how they even got here, just to find out that they were cheating. \n\nJust imagine you work at a nuclear power plant just to find out that the person responsible for your safety and the facility safety are not even qualified for that position. Everything would go boom or the rest of the team would need to compensate for this said persons incompetence.\n\nVALVE please Fix! This as it has retched comedic levels.\nNote, I'm not even laughing!",

Every game I get a hacker and I even purchased Prime which is supposed to help you not get those types of players and it's just as bad. The anti cheat system is a joke. Dont worry though, if theres hackers on  your team and you vote to kick them, you yourself will be banned for kicking people out of the game! ITS AMAZING. Don't pay for prime.

I was in a Mirage premiere matchmaking and noticed that three of my teammates seemed to be from Lebanon. However, instead of communicating and working as a team, they spent the entire game conversing in Arabic in the in-game chat.\n\nNot only was this disruptive for those of us who didn't understand the language, but it quickly became apparent they were discussing other players on the team, including myself. After some time, they even began to insult my ancestors in inappropriate English.\n\nSuch behavior is unacceptable and greatly detracted from the enjoyment of the game. It's unfortunate that such negative experiences can ruin the fun. Hopefully, the development team takes measures to prevent such harassment and ensure a more enjoyable experience for everyone. Until then, I can't recommend Counter Strike 2.",

Let's just say it's not winning any awards.\n- The ranking system is wonky at best, leaving us scratching our heads.\n- Even after switching to MR12, the economy is stuck in the Stone Age.\n- Movement and shooting feel clunkier compared to before, which is a major bummer.\n\n\nUpdate:\n\nJust dropping a line to chat about the recent cooldown changes - two hours is a pretty sweet spot, so thumbs up on that!\n\nBut hey, let's talk about the elephant in the room: hackers. Running into aim bots is a buzzkill, right? And when you're stuck in a match with them, it's like hitting a brick wall. Trying to surrender? Forget about it, vote fails every time. And if you bail early, bam, cooldown city.\n\nOh, and remember that hacker I reported ages ago? Yeah, still seeing them around.

Decided to come back for a lack of interest in other games and I gotta say what a sorry state this is in.\r\n-Server issues in nearly every match makes competitive (premier) matches a disconnected mess, having both sides exhausting their timeouts within the first 5 or so rounds. After that many have to spectate multiple rounds in succession if they get unlucky.\r\nThere's a massive surge in cheaters currently with the recent game updates, allowing you to use console commands that e.g. make smokes invisible, terrain invisible and entity (players and chickens) hitboxes be seen through walls. Just to name a few.\r\nSecurity is terrible. You can report a plain cheater in a premier match and they still haven't been banned a week after. This is partly due to 'overwatch' (CS:GO's long-running anti-cheater system) not being a thing anymore (...yet?).\r\n\r\nReally want to return and grind again like I did nearly 8 years ago, but when every match gives you a sour taste in mouth it's very hard to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nVolvo, please fix",

        "review": "Have played since CSS. The game is literally devolving in front of our very eyes. Cheaters are absolutely the thing that is destroying this game. I know I am not v.s. a cheater in every match, but even 1 cheater every 10 games (high trust factor) is absurd. 3rd party apps say im vs 100 aim players. CS2 is just not playable right now due to the inept anticheat, even in competitive and casual modes. People seem to just be hacking because they know it wont get punished, where they buy alt accounts and just hack with their friends because its edgy. At least with csgo there was a sense that you COULD get banned for hacking (overwatch). CS2 is completely lawless. I will say this- after playing more than 1500 matches since release, 3 people have been banned in those games. Blatant spinners I have faced months ago are still unbanned. What is going on???\n\nThe game is no longer a haven for competitive, fair gunplay. There are other games to offer that, and although the game is fun, I cannot recommend it at all right now. Play something else.",

If you solo que and someone leaves, you are stuffed- and it happens 4 / 5 games from my experience. \n\nGood bits- The game itself is still really good, fun and only has a few small imperfections. \nThe newer gun sounds are great, textures, smokes etc. Game play is still there.\nbut...\n\nCounterstrike has kinda just lost the \"vibe\" that it used to have. Less maps, matchmaking isn't great, loads of cheaters and it feels like the whole game is just about skins now. \n\nLeft COD for something more balanced and quickly realised even CS has gone downhill.",

Playing against cheaters in nearly every match, cheating accusations and paranoia about cheaters, cheater streamers, and talking about cheating online. Well, everyone is talking about it online except Valve who has been radio silent. Zero communication. The game is in a sad state now which detracts from the core game which would be fun otherwise. Even when someone is blatantly spinbotting and everyone reports them and kicks them from the match you'll see them again the next day doing the same thing. There is no anti-cheat and no repercussions for cheating. Apparently Valve has no plan to address this because the game makes too much money for them as-is.\n\nUpdate nearly 20 game hours later: It's gotten worse. Straight-up blatant cheating with no attempt to hide it even in casual games and against bots. It's ridiculous. Beyond the blatant cheating like aimbotting it's obvious many people have wallhacks on when spectated. I'm starting to believe we'll see Half-life 3 before VAC gets fixed and re-enabled.",

You can provide all the info of these people to valve on a silver platter, and still they will do nothing. You can provide them the exact time, date, and server it happened, and they still can't do anything.\r\n\r\nWhat a joke. Die hard fan, dies hard after 20 years supporting the lies of valve. \r\n\r\nDon't buy this game. Wait until they fix it, just know I waited 20 years.\r\n",

Building upon the solid foundation laid by its predecessor, Counter-Strike 2 takes the classic gameplay experience to new heights, delivering an adrenaline-fueled rush that keeps players on the edge of their seats.\n\nOne of the most striking aspects of Counter-Strike 2 is its visual overhaul.

From advanced weapon customization options to dynamic weather effects that impact gameplay, every match feels fresh and unpredictable. The addition of new game modes, including the pulse-pounding Battle Royale, adds even more variety to the mix, ensuring that players never run out of challenges to conquer.\n\nOf course, the heart and soul of Counter-Strike 2 lie in its intense, skill-based combat. The gunplay is as tight and responsive as ever, rewarding precision and strategy over mindless spraying and praying. Whether you're engaging in heart-pounding firefights with friends or testing your mettle against skilled opponents in competitive matchmaking, every kill feels earned, making victory all the sweeter.\n\nBut perhaps what sets Counter-Strike 2 apart from its predecessors is its commitment to community engagement. With robust modding tools and support for user-generated content, the game empowers players to unleash their creativity and shape the future of the franchise. From custom maps and game modes to community-run tournaments and events, the possibilities are endless, ensuring that Counter-Strike 2 remains a vibrant and thriving community for years to come.\n\nIn conclusion, Counter-Strike 2: Evolved Warfare is a triumph of modern gaming. With its stunning visuals, innovative gameplay features, and unwavering dedication to its community, it sets a new standard for the first-person shooter genre.

This game seriously needs a new anti-cheat if I'm getting matched against cheaters 3 games in a row. Other than the cheaters though it seems they are making the right steps towards making this game as playable as CS:GO was. Until a new anti cheat is implemented which at the rate cheating is evolving that could be years down the road, I wouldn't recommend losing sleep or getting pissed off over a competitive game like this one, just play R6S or Valorant, less cheaters, less headache. Also a little addition to this review, where the fuck is skill based matchmaking? It's nowhere's in sight and the same issue with smurfs, plenty games have options to report for smurfing because it literally ruins the experience. Fucking disgrace of a company you're a shell of your former self.",

Now, the thing is, they replaced CSGO with CS2, and removed the possibility to play with friends against bots on release. Now I don't want to be that guy, but the only possible reason I can think of why this is still the case, after more than half a year after release, is that they are trying boost the game statistics by forcing people to play online. And that sucks so, so, so hard. Especially since we could all notice some dubious behaviors from strangers... Well, please just let us have fun among friends. Is that too much to ask for? If possibly without having to resort to unofficial methods. Replacing an existing game should never lead to a loss of functionality.",

If the cheater is on the other team, good luck getting people to kick them. Wasn\u2019t that bad last year but 2024 has been the worst year for CS players. Both low ranks and high ranks are infested by blatant cheaters.\n\nI wish Valve made a kernel level anti cheat mode, at least people who have a gaming-only machine can play competitively while the cheaters play themselves.\nI wouldn\u2019t mind installing Steam OS or similar thing either. Just get rid of the cheating.\n\nI\u2019m avoiding this game for now.",

        "review": "CS2: A Familiar Thrill with a Modern Twist\nAs a seasoned Counter-Strike player with over 12,000 hours invested in the classic CS 1.6, I approached CS2 with a mix of excitement and skepticism. Could a new iteration capture the essence of the original while introducing fresh elements?\n\nThe Good: A Great Game\nCS2 doesn\u2019t disappoint. The core gameplay remains faithful to its roots: intense firefights, strategic team dynamics, and adrenaline-pumping rounds. The familiar maps, weapons, and bomb defusal scenarios evoke nostalgia, transporting me back to those late nights in cyber cafes.\n\nThe graphics have received a much-needed upgrade, and the sound design is immersive. The gunplay feels crisp, and the movement mechanics are spot-on. Whether I\u2019m clutching a round or coordinating with teammates, the rush is real.\n\nThe Uncanny Familiarity\nWhat surprised me most was how CS2 managed to retain that nostalgic magic. Despite being a new game, it feels like slipping into a well-worn pair of sneakers\u2014the fit is just right. The muscle memory from countless 1.6 matches kicks in, and I find myself instinctively trying to bunny-hopping around corners.\n\nThe Bitter Pill: Cheaters\nHowever, there\u2019s a dark cloud over this otherwise sunny battlefield: cheaters. They infest the servers like a relentless virus. Aimbots, wallhacks, and other nefarious tools tarnish the experience. It\u2019s disheartening to see fair matches disrupted by those who prioritise victory over integrity.\n\nValve, please take note: The community needs better anti-cheat measures. We want to enjoy CS2 without constantly questioning opponents\u2019 legitimacy.\n\nFinal Verdict\nCS2 is a worthy successor, bridging the gap between nostalgia and modernity. If you loved CS 1.6 (I don't know how cs:go was), you\u2019ll feel right at home. Just be prepared to encounter a few bad apples along the way. Let\u2019s hope the developers tighten security to preserve the spirit of fair competition.\n\nP.S. To my fellow players: Let\u2019s keep the spirit alive, report cheaters, and make CS2 a better place for everyone! \ud83c\udfae\ud83d\udd2b",

        "review": "I really love Counter-Strike. I loved CS:GO, and I love the idea of CS:2.\n\nWhy is this review bad? Because VALVE fucked up the execution of this idea so bad that It's kinda hard to believe.\n\n1. The Anti-Cheat. It is literally not existent. There are cheaters EVERYWHERE in higher ranks. At launch there were tons of false bans which is what leads me to believe that VALVE disabled the AC until they can make sure that no one is getting falsely banned anymore. Unfortunately this results in spinbotters, aimhackers, wallhackers and bhop-scripters going absolutely wild in comp, premiere and wingman. There are people SPRAYING the AWP and teleporting to the second bomb site in wingman... How is that even possible???\n\n2. The net code. It's bad. Really bad. There is rubber banding, faulty hit reg, the tagging teleports you back from behind cover, movement feels off, and I'm sure there is more that I missed.\n\n3. The Servers. They're now hardcoded to 64 tick afaik., they lag BADLY sometimes. I've had people just teleporting all over the place (this was visible to everyone, not just me), there is constant package loss, downloading demos is buggy sometimes, the subtick system doesn't solve shit (in fact the gameplay feels SO MUCH worse than in any other shooter).\n\n4. The Linux build. VALVE is known to care A LOT about Linux support and so do I. To say that I was disappointed when I first fired up CS:2 on my Linux powered gaming PC would be an understatement. CS:GO's Linux build was flawless. It was better than the Windows build (especially when it comes to performance). But CS:2? Sound didn't work, performance is STILL unacceptable, sound will sometimes vanish in the middle of a game and for some people the game didn't even start up.\n\nAnother fun one is that on certain Mesa versions smokes are invisible! Free and undetectable wallhacks for everyone with and Intel or AMD GPU! Oh wait, the game doesn't work properly on Intel GPUs... I believe this is also the case on Windows so screw Arc users I guess.\n\n5. The WIndows build. You thought VALVE wouldn't fuck up the Windows build? Apparently you're wrong. I don't run the Windows built myself so I can only speak for some of my friends who are running Windows. Apparently it's really unstable. A friend of mine constantly experienced crashes, others had awful performance (just like I have on the Linux build), and Radeon users had a really bad time with shader stutter (at least VALVE fixed that one now).\n\n6. Content. I'm not gonna make a detailed list here, basically CS:2 is missing 60% of CS:GO's content. I'm talking maps, player models, modes, even features and console commands (rip cl_righthand 0...).\n\nNOTE: Left handed view models are back! Game still sux tho.\n\n7. The discontinuation of CS:GO. I wouldn't be so mad if VALVE just gave us the option to continue to play the better CS (CS:GO). Unfortunately, they don't give us this option. Match making is gone and community Servers are almost always completely empty (if you can even find a working one). The Server browser if fucked because it shows both CS:GO and CS:2 Servers and setting up a community Server yourself requires an obscure sourcemods plugin to un-fuck the lobby system. Otherwise no one can join the Server if you disable LAN mode. (The plugin is called NoLobbyReservation).\n\nI know why VALVE did it. But I honestly do not care. If CS:2 is so bad that nobody will play it if they have the option, then it should not be released. Stop forcing this garbage onto us and let us play CS:GO again until you managed to make CS:2 as playable as the other Counter-Strike titles.",

        "review": "I tried to get into this game. I really tried for a whole 36 hours to try and see what it is that so many others like about it. But unfortunately, I could not see anything appealing about it whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe game is essentially a boomer shooter that tries to be tactical and fails, instead creating a meta-based shooter that requires hours of grinding and practice for this one specific game to be good at it. And that's not really not my issue with it either. That's just a negative criticism of it. My issue with it is the fact that its a dated game with technologies and design principles that belong in the 90s dressed up to look modern and somehow, the fans eat it all up and swear by it.\r\n\r\nThe concept of this game is actually quite fresh, so much so, that its very unique even today. The fact that there are opposing sides with differing, clashing objectives with their own unique advantages and disadvantages that are still balanced out by their own field performance with the use of the economy system. The concept of this game was revolutionary when it came out and it still remains unique to this very day. The only other game that has ever implemented this concept has to be Valorant and there is no other rival for CS, really.\r\n\r\nHowever, this amazing concept goes down the drain because of the way things are handled and implemented in the game. The technologies felt dated to me back when I first played one of the CS franchise games back in 2007, albeit they felt more modern back then. But when I play this game today, nothing has really changed about the game over the ages. It's still the same old Counter Strike just updated with modern graphics and textures and that's pretty much it. The only advancement that this game has comes by way of visual aesthetics. And with the CS2 update, they have finally mastered the art of Volumetric Smoke, something that the world had already begun implementing in their games more than a decade ago.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the technologies remain practically the same as they were with the original game that came out back in the 2000s. They still use a static recoil pattern that they expect players to drill into their muscle memory. Even the gun doesn't bounce around and there typically aren't a whole lot of tracers that tell you where your shot is going. Delta Force from 1998 had dynamic recoil patterns and bullet velocities down, but somehow, 26 years later, Valve still doesn't want to do it despite all the other games having that very thing. The only time you'll find some semblance of recoil is when you're scoped in. Then there are the point object  players in this game. While most modern shooters, especially tactical shooters use actual ragdoll physics for their players, CSGO sticks to the old point physics for players to move their own characters instead. This allows them to climb onto walls and ledges like a goat that a typical military operator or terrorist would never be able to climb or go through in real life. For a game that clearly tries to be tactical, this is a huge oversight that only reinforces the meta gaming nature of this game.\r\n\r\nSomethign else that makes this game heavily dependent on said Metas are the maps. To comment on the maps themselves, they are not the best at any rate. The angles are odd and awkward for a competitive shooter, but at least they are realistic. Despite that, there a whole lot of underutilised empty space thhat serves almost no purpose except for a transit from point A to point B. One can say that this reinforces a more strategic approach to the game as players must work as a team to utilise proper offensive and defensive strategies before every round. And that's yet again, a wonderful concept if the game hadn't already been ruined by the metas. And the primary reason for that is the fact that the maps are overplayed and run through, having received next to no updates since the year 2000 when the game first came out. And even then, the updates that have been rolled out only seek to remove some of the metas that the players heavily rely on that Valve thought are exploitative in nature. In any other game, these metas would, in fact, be called exploits. What Valve needs to realise is the fact that when players have been playing the same maps over and over again for the past quarter of a century, they will figure out how to exploit every nook and cranny of the map to gain an advantage. And that's exactly what the players are doing. They've figured out how to exploit the metas to win and it has become a game of just that.\r\n\r\nPeople like to say that CS is a skill based shooter, and honestly, it's not. Skill is definitely a factor in the game, but it's far more about practicing the metas and committing them to memory than it is about skills or tactics. You can't always out-skill an unfair meta and tactics don't really work out that well when there really aren't a whole lot of features on the map to exploit said tactics. At least the team based strategy aspect of the game still manages to work out to a degree. I can dominate a deathmatch or an arms race but I can't do the same in a typical bomb defusal scenario since folks don't know how to leverage the metas in the former whereas they know exaactly how to do so in the latter. New players practically need a guide that is experienced with all the metas of the game to show them how to play it and then they need to grind countless hours into perfecting them just so that they can finally begin playing the game effectively. That is not common behaviour for a multiplayer game. You only get to see this in a handful of games that are complex, and given the lack of complexity to CS, it's a surprise that this is a thing until you're faced with all the metas. Valve is seemingly so afraid of changing this game that they're practically running it into the ground despite the fanbase vehemently coming out in support of it.\r\n\r\nCS is a franchise that is in dire need of modernisation. And the way to achieve that is by changing the formula that they're using for their competitive scene and shifting things around drastically. That's something that Valve is seemingly afraid of doing. The way towards modernisation and remaining up to date does NOT come by way of trying to copy other games by adding Danger Zone to your game. That albeit a fresh change of pace, felt like a subpar Call of Duty clone. By this point, I feel like I've drilled my point in quite a bit. The mechanics and maps are outdated and the whole culture in CS has become one of drilling metas so that you can play it properly by exploiting said metas. Some of the game mechanics such as fixed recoil patterns and the point physics even reinforce this very behaviour. If anything, CS is modern game only as far as the graphics are concerned. Everything else about it is terribly dated and I have no idea why the fans love to slurp it all up.",

The number 1 most concerning flaws in this game was the cheaters, and it has just GOTTEN WORSE..\n\nThe amount of time I'm getting banned because team-killing a cheater is huge, like standing for the right thing only gets you punished in this game... cheaters have no place on the Leaderboards, in this game, nor in life...\n\nValve better grow some fucking balls and do what deemed necessary, THE FACT that Valve HASN'T DONE ANYTHING to resolve this issue IS A MOCKERY TO THE GAME, to the FANS, and to everyone else involved in building this supposed to be beautiful game \n\nEven their last MAJOR (Professional E-Sport Scene they held) is FLOODED WITH CHEATERS!\n\nFace-It (In game server providers), and Valorant by Riot (their competitor) has shown that this situations are caused whether by IGNORANCE or straight INCOMPETENCE on VALVE's behalf...\n\nI WHOLEHEARTEDLY say that I CANNOT in my GOOD CONSCIENCE, to recommend this game for anyone on the market looking for an FPS Game right now... \n\nCounter Strike is DEAD, and only Valve themselves can bring it back to life... \n\nEven tough I hopefully praying that they will, I will not keep playing while the developers themselves who proclaimed to \"love Counter Strike the most\" hasn't stop the mockery to the game itself....\n\nTo anyone who is reading this and deciding whether should you buy the \"Prime Status\" or not... do yourself better, and spend your Hard-Earned money elsewhere for they are mocking and disrespecting all of you who still buys the game, in games add-ons, case, key, etc.\n\nBest wishes, just know that WE DESERVES BETTER.",

        "review": "Nostalgia for Counter-Strike 1.6, and over time, for CSGO, fuels my desire to play this legendary game. But why do I give it a poor rating, you might ask? I'll try to answer briefly, though it won't be short anyway. The thing is, this game is like a beloved dish you crave to enjoy, but there's always something wrong with it: either it's too raw, underseasoned, or instead of salt, they added sugar, and every time, you simply can't fully enjoy it due to someone else's cooking mistakes! More specific examples of problems are as follows: the shooting mechanics in the game are quite difficult; the simple logic of aiming and shooting in this game is flawed, and if you say \"that's part of the challenge,\" you're wrong - often, you'll see how you can aim at a target 30 meters away and end up hitting the ground near your feet, defying the laws of physics. Eventually, you might get used to this kind of shooting and hone your skills over time, BUT the random effect undermines this refined shooting system. Look at the pro scene; even pro players often fail due to \"It didn't hit\", meaning the same random effect interfered with their shooting skills, which is impossible to overcome. \nAnd now, delving deeper into the mire, after playing this game (aside from LAN), you'll often encounter hit registration problems that have almost never been fixed since CSGO times, often simply being ignored. If at the beginning of your tough player journey you don't feel this pain, the more you face strong opponents, the more important your shots will become, determining the fate of rounds or even the entire game. Imagine this: a challenging match where you're carrying your whole team, and then that moment when you're about to achieve an ace and hear applause from your teammates... But the server tells you, 'Sorry, your AWP shot didn't register, better luck next time,' and you lose because of an unregistered hit. That's the moment of intense pain. And yes, you can't solve the hit registration problem no matter how rarely it occurs.\nThe next problem with the game, not just in LAN, will be the same hit registration issues, but often against you. This is a perfect method of inflicting pain, real pain. Imagine a situation where you dash behind a wall, and suddenly you're an unreachable target for the enemy, but BAM, congratulations, you're dead; a hit is registered a meter behind you. The feeling in that moment is impossible to convey. And with this, you can't do anything; again, even if this phenomenon doesn't happen often.\nLet's talk about CHEATERS in this game separately. The damned cheaters don't let you enjoy the game, and thanks to them, you'll again experience large doses of real pain. The frustration is incredible. And you can't do anything about cheaters because the reporting system from Valve works like a bicycle without wheels: no matter how much you pedal, you can't get anywhere. It seems like there's hardly any fight against cheaters in this game; it appears that the developers have simply given up on it.\nI still have a lot more I want to mention in this review, but instead of writing it all to you, I have an endless desire to jab someone in the ribs. Primarily, I want to jab to cheaters who turn this game into a dumpster, and secondarily, I want to jab the developers who do almost NOTHING about the numerous problems in the game.\nThe game is cool; at first, I wanted to write a good review, but then I remembered that it's still Counter-Strike 2, not Counter-Strike 1.6.",

My biggest complaint is actually getting into a server.\n\nEven though my wait time is 10-20 seconds, CS keeps putting me in either Full Bot servers, OR Servers that I just left and forces me to play with the some players.\n\nEven though over it says on the stats screen, 8000 players are playing and 200k servers available at the time of the que, Im not seeing any variety. I tried getting matchmaked into a new server over 10 times at one point and it kept putting me in the SAME SERVER with the SAME BOTS/PLAYERS.\n\nSo, in my opinion if you play for free, its GREAT. But, I would not reccomend spending 15$ until they fix the server issues. Also, there is almost no Community Servers at all, unlike the old days.",

However, through the rage, it really does come down to being a \"skill issue,\" which I respect so much. The fact that I actually have to play to get better to achieve a better play-style instead of relying on some broken meta is so cool and fun to me. I heard someone say this game is like chess with guns. That probably is the best way to describe this game. I suck at this game, but the more I play, the more I notice tiny little advancements in my gameplay. That to me is a true multiplayer game. Through playing and learning maps, angles, guns, different situations, etc. you can really have some fun with this game. One of my current favorite multiplayer games that I want to strive to get better in. \r\n\r\nI recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge and is eager to learn a new shooter that takes skill and patience.",

Blatant wallhacking, aimbotting and even sometimes spinbotting is an everyday phenomena, which makes this game kind of unplayable at the moment. And no, I don't think that Faceit or any other service can fix the issue. The cheating is done on so many levels that it's easy to circumvent any anticheat that is available to the game. It's sad, because CS is an awesome game otherwise. Right now, If you encounter non cheating enemies that can play the game, U find yourself second guessing; are they cheating or not. Considering that this game is one of the biggest esport titles, the brokenness is just sad.",

Cheaters running amok in almost every match and not getting banned, less than half the maps from CSGO are in the game, removed map specific character models, etc.. I had high hopes for the game but I was super disappointed in September when CS2 released. Althogh I still have some faith regarding the future of this game, I have a bad feeling that I won't be playing anytime soon.",

        "review": "As an avid fan of competitive shooters, I find it necessary to address the stark differences between Valorant and Counter Strike 2. Valorant, while attempting to innovate within the genre, falls embarrassingly short when compared to the timeless masterpiece that is Counter Strike 2. One of the primary shortcomings of Valorant lies in its lackluster gameplay mechanics. The clunky movement and unresponsive gunplay make for an unsatisfying experience, especially when juxtaposed with the fluidity and precision of Counter Strike 2. Additionally, Valorant's reliance on character abilities disrupts the purity of skill-based gameplay that Counter Strike 2 epitomizes, introducing an unnecessary layer of complexity that detracts from the core shooting mechanics.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the design philosophy behind Valorant's maps pales in comparison to the meticulously crafted layouts of Counter Strike 2. While Counter Strike 2 maps are ingeniously balanced and provide ample opportunities for strategic play, Valorant's maps feel uninspired and lack the intricate details that contribute to dynamic gameplay scenarios. The result is a tedious and repetitive experience that fails to captivate players in the same way that Counter Strike 2's maps do, where every corner and chokepoint is meticulously designed to facilitate intense and strategic encounters.\r\n\r\nLastly, the lack of a vibrant and thriving esports scene in Valorant further solidifies its inferiority to Counter Strike 2. Despite Riot Games' efforts to promote Valorant as a competitive esport, it has failed to garner the same level of excitement and engagement as Counter Strike 2 tournaments. Counter Strike 2's rich legacy in the esports realm, coupled with its time-tested gameplay mechanics and dedicated community, cements its status as the superior choice for fans of competitive shooters. In conclusion, Valorant may have attempted to emulate the success of Counter Strike 2, but it ultimately falls short in nearly every aspect, making it an absolute disappointment for those seeking a true competitive gaming experience.",

Game is total ass compared to the older Counter Strike games (even compared to CS:GO). Please bring back CS:GO as a seperate playable game as that was a lot more fun and more nostalgic for players who enjoyed the original Counter Strike games. Thanks Valve for making this game shitty and more trend and fad based instead of the basis of the original Counter Strike games. BRING BACK CS:GO!",

I have ran into a few different cheaters during my time playing the game. It appears from reading reviews of others experiences here on Steam, and Reddit, this game may want to invest in a better anti cheat software. In terms of gameplay, it takes teamwork and map knowledge in order to consistently win matches.  For a long time, I disliked Counter Strike  because I did not understand the mechanics of the game well. After sinking more hours into the game, I realized that Counter Strike has a high skill gap, and that there is a ton to learn. Now that I am older, I enjoy this aspect of CS2. In all, I would recommend anyone interested in S&D or R6 to try this game if you have not already. I believe this is what those modes/games aspire to be. Enjoy the original recipe.",

You just watch your teammate standing behind a wall, watching his feet, trying to have his aimbot shoot before the opponent's hack does. If he fails the round is done and you die by a wallbang headshot out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nLegit good players which used to be Global Elite on CSGO, or level 10 Face, are now ranked silvers in competitive because everything above is just hackers.\r\n\r\nOn premier you have at least 2-3 cheaters per game. Usually they start slow trying not to look suspicious but when they start loosing rounds cause the opponents are cheating too, they turn on everything they have.\r\n\r\nVAC was once a respected anti cheat system that would make players fear for their account. Now I see people everyday with 1500+ hours of CS on their account wallhacking and aimboting blatantly like they don't care.\r\n\r\nCheat developpers even implemented a function in their hack so you can change the skin of your guns and add the stickers you want on the fly. They're having they're best life. There's even a market where hundreds of tousands of cheaters offer or sell their configs for the cheat.\r\n\r\nIf nothing happens fast, this game is dead.
